## Project: Rural Tourism

### Sponsor Description
Founded in 1957 in Rabat, Mohammed V University was the country’s first post-independence public university. Today, more than 1,800 faculty and 80,000 students (including almost 2,500 international students) teach, research and study in a series of undergraduate programs, graduate programs and certificate programs on multiple campuses across the city. 

### Project Description
Morocco’s tourism sector has been heavily impacted by ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, Morocco closed its borders, making it very difficult for the tourist industry, once thriving, to make a profit. Small tourist businesses in villages across rural Morocco, where profit is motivated by forgein demand, are struggling to keep their doors open. A small group of villages in rural southern Morocco, Imlil has, until relatively recently, served as a gathering point for tourists and locals from Tamatert, Ait Souka, Tagadirt, Armed, Acheim, Taourirt n'Ait Mizane, Mzikene and Arhrene. Its geographic location made it the center of Morocco’s mountain tourism; it’s considered a place to rent the equipment needed and hire guides as well as a place to rest and relax after ascending Mount Toubkal, the highest summit in North Africa.

Tamatert is home to five small “auberges” (inns: Les jardins de l’Atlas, Hiba Lodge, Douar Samraa, Kasbah and Atlas Tamatert). Each has ratings of at least 9 out of 10 on booking.com; reviewers remark on their exceptional experiences. But, given ongoing COVID-related travel restrictions and the precipitous drop in tourism, the owners are struggling to get the local tourists to visit the village, have a meal (especially those coming from Marrakech, the closest big city) and spend the night, which offers the largest profit margins.

Using bottom-up research methodology, Dr. Rhajbal is asking WPI’s Morocco Project Center to:
identify the needs and desires of local tourists, forgein tourists and their differences;
develop communication strategies based in storytelling that document the everyday lives of these auberges’ owners as well as the resources tourists can find in Tamatert; 
create a platform dedicated to serving small auberges in the region. Ideally, this platform will allow local and foreign tourists to get information about the area, to plan itineraries, book trips, rent equipment, etc; 
create a brand and logo for the village; and
identify the village’s assets and attractions.

Students will travel to Tamatert, meet with locals and auberge owners, and learn about the area. While in Tamatert, members of the team will experience the auberges first as customers and then as a member of the staff, thus facilitating an immersion experience. This hybrid methodology, braiding together qualitative and a quantitative methods, will help students:
Understand what auberges should do to better serve the local tourists’ needs and desires;
Using qualitative data gathered, create content that effectively communicates the positive experiences customers relay about the auberges;
Review the auberges’ marketing strategy and do an internal and external diagnosis of these businesses; and
Create an independent platform that local auberges owners will manage that allows them to avoid the high commissions charged by predatory booking platforms. 

Given the familiarity with the local site that this project requires, students should plan to travel to Tamatert as a group (in a trip that will be coordinated by the project sponsor) to meet with the inn owners and conduct fieldwork.

            <p>
              <b>Purpose:</b> To gather as much information as possible from the project description and begin planning effective research strategies.  This is also an opportunity to identify information that you do not yet know or need to know to make your project successful.
              Your project description provides crucial information about your project. As a team, analyze it and answer the following questions. Prepare the information in whatever format you think most useful for your work (lists, tables, paragraphs, etc.).
              About the Project:
              Goals: What does the sponsor hope to gain from the project?
              Insights into the needs/desires of local tourists and how to encourage/attract more local tourism to the area 
              Brand the village in a positive light and determine its most desirable assets
              
              <b>Underlying problem:</b> What motivates the project? Why is it important (to sponsor and others)? What is the larger societal issue the project is addressing? 
              <p>Struggling to attract local tourists to visit village and use their facilities
                We are addressing the livelihood of inn owners and those who work in the area
                The pandemic has caused these local places to lose valuable tourists. This trend can also be seen around the world, so this project addresses a larger global issue as well
                Forming a cohesive identity as a group of auberges on the regional and eventually international tourism market 
                Major booking companies have a monopoly on the tourism market preventing locals from profiting from tourists.</p>
              
              <b>Objectives:</b> <p>What specific objectives, tasks, or questions does the sponsor envision for the project (i.e., big steps necessary to complete the project)?
                Identify needs/desires of local tourists through survey/feedback
                Understand how local business has been affected by the pandemic, and how to combat this
                Create new branding and a logo for the business to gain more attraction, and have a more interactive surface when tourists are not on site
                Document the lives of the small business owners through thoughtful communication and storytelling 
                Develop a platform to support the auberges’ businesses through streamlining information, advertisement, and booking services while keeping the humanity of the owners/employees a central part of the marketing </p>
                <b>Stakeholders:</b> <p>Who will your project impact?  Identify the internal and external stakeholders of your project?
                Project will impact locals, small business owners (auberge owners), their employees, and those who will travel to the village
                Internally - people in the towns, auberge owners
                Externally - the town itself (reputation, marketing, “logo”), local tourists and foreign tourists, 
                Where does the sponsor fit in ?</p>
              
              <b>Methods:</b> <p>What techniques does the sponsor suggest you use to meet the project objectives (field work, surveys, interviews, database development, etc.)?
                Interviews with the inn owners/employees
                Interviews with local and foreign tourists
                Database development/research to help create the platform that inn owners and tourists can use
                Field work to get an idea of the area and determine desirable assets to help the brand </p>
              
              <b>Outcomes:</b> <p>What tangible products does the sponsor envision you will create by the end of the project?
                A platform that the auberges can use to share their accommodation information, and also serve as a way for tourists to book their products
                Brand and logo</p>
              
              
              
              
              <b>What new information do you need to learn/know?</b> 
              <div>
                Available background resources: What documents, organizations, theories, data – anything! – does the sponsor provide or suggest you access to understand or begin developing your project. Create an inventory of such resources with a brief description of their relevance to the project.
              Current organizations running in Tamatert
              data on tourism stats for Morocco (specifically Tamatert?) before and after the pandemic - determine how the pandemic has affected tourism
              Details about the marketing strategies being used now or previously to promote tourism
              Any changes to the business due to covid, such as accommodations or updated safety protocols
              The history of the area to better understand the cultural appeal of the villages 
              Maps of the area - the best ways tourists can enter the area, and other attractions nearby they could go to
              </div>
              
              <b>New Research Questions/Topics: Based on the above information, make a list of questions or topics you believe will help you organize your project research. Try brainstorming lots of questions first, then organize them thematically. </b>
              <div>What currently makes the village and these inn desirable for local/foreign tourists?
                How can we make the process of booking trips efficient for tourists?
                What is the most effective way to market the village? 
                What are other platforms currently being used to book trips? What are their commissions of them? How is it affecting inn owners?
                How do auberges operate? Before and during COVID?
                What can the rest of the village gain from improving the auberges tourism market?
                Why do previous tourists choose to stay at competing booking platform?
                How has COVID impacted the attendance of tourists to the area and to the auberges?
                What did tourism look like before the pandemic hit? 
                Is there a main reason other than travel that tourists do not come to the area?
                What are the auberge's strongest features? Can these be improved? 
                What is tourism like in Morocco
                How much money does morocco generate from tourism
                What are attitudes about traveling (esp with covid) for moroccans</div>
                
              <b>Your Research Strategies: The nitty gritty! Based on all of the above, brainstorm a list of strategies for finding relevant background information: where to look, what kind of search terms to use, what kind of organizations might have the kind of stuff you need, etc. You might try connecting these up then with your Research Questions/Topics somehow.</b>
               <div> A travel commission/board in Morocco may have info on commercial flights to the country/specific cities to give an idea on how foreign tourism changed pre→ post covid
                A local travel commission may have data on how many tourists pre/post covid
                Inns may have data on tourists staying pre/post covid (how long people stay, are they local, etc).
                Marketing strategies and examples of marketing entire villages/areas within a Moroccan cultural context (visitmorocco or a visitmarrakech type of marketing program)
                Existing platforms such as bookings.com or other travel platforms to see how accommodations are marketed online
                Search for reviews from customers that have traveled to these auberges to learn about their thoughts on the quality of the accommodation 
                History of the auberges and village
                History of foreign and local tourism in Morocco
                Any research on improving visitation/tourism during covid?</div>
              
               <b>What’s Missing: What questions do you still have about your project? What is confusing to you? What do you need help with?  What do you need from your advisor? What do you need from your ID2050 Instructor? </b>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The goal of this project is to help auberge owners develop a platform to positively market the village’s attractions and inns which will lead to greater outreach to local tourists. 
                    </li>
                    <li>                
                      We want to help auberge owners develop a platform to positively market the village’s attractions and market the village to bring in money from foreign and local tourists.
                    </li>
                    <li>                
                      Effectively communicate with and understand the Tamatert auberge owners, in order to efficiently help them market the assets of their organization.
